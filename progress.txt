Modified GUI , popup  Add dialog now is complete and can add data to database and close after notify that everything is done and back to parent form with a new database (contain a new question)

Add dialog contain 3 controls (Datagridview ,textbox and numericupdown ) datagridview shows database attributes without any record and it’s just read only , textbox to write questions , numericupdown it is also readonly and the minimum value is the maximum value of question order to avoid duplication of primary key ,you can change question order but with higher orders than in database.

Delete dialog is also ready but didn’t change in database , this will be next step ,
